            It's important for subfertile couples to undergo a thorough evaluation by
            fertility expert. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of all potential
            factors contributing to infertility and ensures that appropriate treatment
            strategies are implemented to optimize the chances of conception.
        </p>
        <b>These are the tests that should be done by a couple:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Semen Analysis: It helps assess the man's fertility potential and can
                identify issues such as low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or abnormal sperm
                morphology. </li>
            <li> Detailed Pelvic Scan: A pelvic ultrasound or transvaginal
                ultrasound is done to assess the pelvic organs- the uterus & ovaries. It helps
                identify the egg reserve by checking Antral Follicle count(AFC), structural
                abnormalities or conditions such as fibroids, ovarian cysts, or polyps that may
                affect fertility. </li>
            <li>Tube Test or Hysterosalpingography (HSG): HSG is a specialized imaging
                procedure used to evaluate the patency of the fallopian tubes and detect any
                blockages or abnormalities. During HSG, a contrast dye is injected into the
                uterus, and X-ray images are taken to visualize the flow of the dye through the
                fallopian tubes. </li>
            <li> Hormonal Analysis: In women, this includes testing for
                hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone
                (LH),Anti Mullerian Hormone(AMH), estradiol, progesterone, and thyroid function
                tests. In men, hormonal analysis may involve testing testosterone levels and
                other hormone levels related to sperm production. These basic evaluations
                provide valuable information about the couple's fertility status and help guide
                further diagnostic testing or treatment options. Depending on the results of
                these initial assessments, additional tests or procedures may be recommended to
                pinpoint the specific cause of infertility and develop a tailored treatment
                plan.</li>
