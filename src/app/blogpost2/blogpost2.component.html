        <b>WHAT IS INFERTILITY</b>
        <p>
            Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after actively trying for a certain period of time, typically one year for couples under the age of 35, and six months for couples over the age of 35. Most healthy couples (8 out of 10) will conceive within this timeframe if they have regular, unprotected intercourse.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The incidence of infertility is quite high, with approximately one in every six couples experiencing challenges when trying to conceive. It could either be female factor, male factor or a combination of both. The common causes are ovulation disorders, hormonal imbalances, issues with sperm production or function, tubal factors, uterine abnormalities, and age-related factors.
            </li>
            <li>
                When a couple is not successful in conceiving after one year of trying, it is important for them to seek evaluation and guidance from a healthcare provider specializing in infertility. Both partners should undergo a comprehensive fertility assessment, which may include medical history review, physical examinations, hormonal testing, imaging studies, and semen analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on the results of the evaluation, treatment options for infertility may vary. These could include lifestyle modifications, medication to induce ovulation, surgical interventions to correct anatomical issues, intrauterine insemination (IUI), or assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).
            </li>
            <li>
                Fertility experts can provide personalized care, guidance, and support throughout the fertility journey, helping couples navigate the emotional and physical challenges associated with infertility and increase their chances of achieving a successful pregnancy.
