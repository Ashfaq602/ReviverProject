                Before planning the treatment, the technology considers various factors, such as the patient's age, health condition, and the tumor's location. It generates multiple treatment plans quickly, from which the doctor chooses the best one for each day.

                The Ethos platform helps in treating cancer by delivering radiation to the tumor location in a precise and personalized manner. It does this by adjusting the radiation delivery based on the patient's unique anatomy, with real-time optimizations ensuring that the treatment is accurate and effective, this allows doctors to plan and administer the treatment quickly and efficiently so patients can spend less time in the treatment process and recover faster. The whole process is closely monitored during every fraction to ensure better results.

                information obtained is always presented in a simple and clear way. This helps radiation oncologists to make the right decisions about how to treat their patients. It also helps ensure that patients get the best possible radiation treatment.
